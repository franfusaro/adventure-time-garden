# Adventure Time Garden
Adventure Time Garden is a tower defense game made in Unity based on the [C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code by Making Video Games](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WjsAkoTcF9UQH4=) course in Udemy.

In the course, this game is originally a common tower defense game based on the Glitch Garden game (Similar to Plants vs Zombies). I gave it a twist by ideating it on an Adventure Time world (A Cartoon Network fantasy animated television series).

You can [Play it](https://franfusaro.github.io/adventure-time-garden) on GitHub Pages on any desktop browser! Now with tutorial!. Enjoy :)
